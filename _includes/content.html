<h2>About Community</h2>
<p>Compass has been designed with something very specific in mind: to be a simple and elegant personal landing page.</p>

<h2>Public chat policies</h2>
Actually, we don`t have any, but:
<ul>
  <li>respect others plz</li>
  <li>hate speech is strictly prohibited</li>
  <li>do not flood the chat with stickers</li>
  <li>the main topic is hacking and all that is associated with, try not to offtopic.</li>
  <li>the chat is public and is constantly monitored by the CP and the SSU,so always remember this, it's not a joke, mate.</li>
</ul>
